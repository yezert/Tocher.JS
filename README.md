### A framework for original HTML , Javascript and Css

## Why Touch?


Touch.JS references many valuable frameworks and optimizes them into them. We firmly believe that after continuous efforts, it may eventually become one of the choices for front-end development


## What frameworks does Touch.js borrow from?

Touch.JS draws on the following frameworks: 
- #### Vue.js (more) 
- #### React.js 
- #### Svelte.js


## Why is there no documentation for Touch.JS?

The documentation is under development and will be placed in the source code later, and we hope you will give this project and a star and a follow-up, so that you can see the update as soon as possible in the future

## What if there is no documentation?

We are developing some examples that you can learn about Touch.js first. And the source code isn't particularly confusing to read, and you can also read it to learn Touch.js
